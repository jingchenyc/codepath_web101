# Intro to Web Development

## Overview
This repository showcases my learning process during the **Intro to Web Development** course. Through this 10-unit course, I explored foundational concepts in web development and progressively built a fully-functioning website. The README serves as a guide to the course structure and provides insights into each unit’s content and coursework.

### Live Demo
You can view the live project [here](https://eggshell-radiant-programmer-257.vscodeedu.app).

## Course Structure
The course is project-based, emphasizing hands-on learning. Each unit introduces new web development concepts that are applied to the ongoing project. By the end of the course, the project evolved into a comprehensive website presented on Demo Day.

### Key Features
- **10 units** covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web animations.
- Weekly project milestones to solidify learning.
- Final website presentation in Unit 10.

### Project Milestones
Each milestone builds on the previous units’ work:
- **Milestone #1:** Initial project setup (Unit 1)
- **Milestone #2:** Advanced styling and layout (Unit 4)
- **Milestone #3:** Interactivity with JavaScript (Unit 7)
- **Milestone #4:** Polished animations and final presentation (Unit 9)

## Personal Reflections
This course allowed me to explore the essentials of web development. The project-based structure helped reinforce my understanding of:
- Building responsive layouts with HTML and CSS.
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript.
- Creating dynamic and visually appealing animations.

By the end of the course, I gained confidence in creating web projects and collaborating in a team setting.
